# Packaging & Installers

Terraform Guardrail MCP ships with packaging templates and release artifacts that support:

- Homebrew (macOS)
- Chocolatey (Windows)
- `curl | bash` (Linux)

Release artifacts are generated by the GitHub workflow `Packaging` on tags. Publishing workflows
can push one-liner installs when the required secrets are configured:

- `HOMEBREW_TAP_REPO` (for example `Huzefaaa2/homebrew-tap`)
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`
- `CHOCO_API_KEY`

## Homebrew

We generate a formula template at release time and publish to a tap when secrets are set:

- `terraform-guardrail.rb` (release asset)

Once the tap is published, install with:

```bash
brew install Huzefaaa2/tap/terraform-guardrail
```

## Chocolatey

We generate a Chocolatey package definition and publish it when `CHOCO_API_KEY` is set:

- `terraform-guardrail.nuspec`
- `tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1`

Install with:

```powershell
choco install terraform-guardrail
```

### Local testing

When installing from a local package source (for example `dist/packaging/chocolatey`), include
the community feed so the `python` dependency can resolve, or install Python ahead of time.

```powershell
# Local package + community feed for dependencies
choco install terraform-guardrail --version $version -s "$dest;https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/" -y
```

## Linux (curl | bash)

We ship a simple installer:

- `scripts/install.sh` (release asset)

Usage:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/Huzefaaa2/terraform-guardrail/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the latest PyPI version into the user environment.
