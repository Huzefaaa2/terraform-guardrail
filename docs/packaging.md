# Packaging & Installers

Terraform Guardrail MCP ships with packaging templates and release artifacts that support:

- Homebrew (macOS)
- Chocolatey (Windows)
- `curl | bash` (Linux)

Release artifacts are generated by the GitHub workflow `Packaging` on tags.

## Homebrew

We generate a formula template at release time:

- `terraform-guardrail.rb` (release asset)

Future step: publish a Homebrew tap so `brew install terraform-guardrail` works without manual
downloads.

## Chocolatey

We generate a Chocolatey package definition:

- `terraform-guardrail.nuspec`
- `tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1`

Future step: publish the package to Chocolatey so `choco install terraform-guardrail` works
globally.

## Linux (curl | bash)

We ship a simple installer:

- `scripts/install.sh` (release asset)

Usage:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/Huzefaaa2/terraform-guardrail/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

This installs the latest PyPI version into the user environment.
